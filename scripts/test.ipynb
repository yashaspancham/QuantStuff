As a reminder, all participant lines will be in listen -only mode, and \\nthere will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.  \\n I now hand the conference over to Mr. Shekhar Swarup, Joint Managing Director from Globus \\nSpirits Limited. Thank you, and over to you, sir.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q4 and FY'24 Earnings Call . Our \\npresentation has been uploaded on the exchange, and I hope you had a chance to go through it. \\nThere's been some technical difficulties with the network and the servers to upload the results. \\nI'm informed that that's happening right now. And I apologi ze for the inconvenience caused. \\nMeanwhile, I will go ahead with the opening remarks to this call.  \\n In this quarter onwards, we now are analyzing our performance separately for our brands as well \\nas manufacturing business. In the presentation that was uploaded, you would have found a \\ndifferent way of analyzing the performance and I hope you will continue  to find it useful in the \\nquarters to come.  \\nIn Q4 FY'24, we saw unprecedented low margin due to a change in the raw material mix as FCI \\ndiscontinued rice supplies for manufacturing of bulk alcohol. If you recall, the stop had taken \\nplace in August of 2023. And in this period, we have bridged the gap  in raw material supplies \\nlargely with rice purchased from the open market and the margin for this product was very low \\nin this quarter gone by.  \\nWe are, however, now  very excited about the prospects of using maize for ethanol with a higher \\nrealization for final product, which is ethanol, better by -products yield and a better \\nenvironmental footprint. Maize is quite possibly the correct crop for ethanol production in Ind ia.  \\nWith maize, the company can also reduce dependence on intermediaries such as rice mills. And \\nwe hope that in the next 1 or 2  years, we will be able to secure long -term pricing for maize, in \\nline with ethanol orders and hope to eliminate volatility in margins altogether.  \\nGoing forward, we believe that the bulk business, which is a combination of ENA and ethanol, \\nour EBITDA margins in this business will be at around INR7 a liter. We will see periods of high \\nmargins as well as periods of low margins. But as an average of cyc le, INR7 per liter of EBITDA \\nmargin is something I believe the company will achieve. In fact, we are already seeing a positive \\nchange towards this direction in Q1 on the back of maize, as I explained earlier.  \\n After certain pending regulatory approvals were complete in Q4, our total installed capacity \\npending regulatory approvals for Jharkhand and West Bengal expansion that is, our total \\ninstalled capacity now stands at 300 million liters per year. And more recently, in Q1, we have \",\n",

The objective of this venture is to engage in the \\ndistribution, marketing and manufacturing of Carib Beer in India. Carib Beer is a trademark \\nowned by ANSA McAL and is a very popular beer in parts of the world. We plan to contract \\nmanufacture the beer in India to start with, and we expect launch in Q1 of FY'26.  \\n I request Param to provide an update on the consumer business.  \\nParamjit Gill:  Thank you, Shekhar. Good afternoon, everyone. Coming to our high -growth Prestige & Above \\nsegment , for the quarter gone by, we witnessed a sales volume of 0.13 million cases with a \\ngrowth of 170%. For the full year, also the performance has been robust. Our full year volumes \\nstood at 0.38 million cases with a growth of 84% year -on-year. We continue to ex pect strong \\ngrowth even in the current financial year on this account, and we expect profitability to improve \\nfurther as the volume growth con tinue to come in and the route -to-market efficiencies start \\nkicking in through some of the early states.  \\n In the next couple of quarters, we obviously want to plan to launch a few new and innovative \\nbrands across some exciting categories as well. These brands will ride on the route -to-market \\nstrength that we have created in the first few states and the partner ships set us by us successfully \\nso far. We are also going to be expanding our distribution presence, which currently stands at 6 \\nstates to another 2 states during the coming quarters.  \\n Coming to Regular & Others segment. We continue to perform well for the company with a total \\nvolume of 3.43 million and a growth of 8% year -on-year and total profitability of INR292 \\nmillion, with a growth of 21% year -on-year. For the full year, this number of volume stands at \\n14.16 million and profitability at INR1,404 million with 22% year -on-year growth. The Regular \\n& Others is an entrenched mature business with high market shares in Rajasthan.  \\nWe are planning to enter this segment in UP in the coming quarter. And this state is a sizable \\nopportunity, and we are very excited about the possibilities that this will create for us. Our recent \\nbrand launches of Mountain Oak and SNOSKI Vodka in the Pres tige & Above segment have \\nbeen very well received across markets. These 2 brands are going to get expanded into the \\nbalanced markets as we start getting approvals from excise in the new policies.  \\n Our latest offering of RTD, which is named Not Out has just been launched in Delhi and the \\ninitial prospects are encouraging. And we will see through its further expansion in the coming \\nquarters to the second and the third states. As you will note that the  green shoots of our strategy \\nto strengthen our market capability first state by state and then riding on it with an array of \\nbrands to succeed is now you'd seem to be yielding results. And I'm very happy to share that 3 \\nout of the first choice of 5 state s are in a good position to start benefiting from this strategy as \\nwe have entered our third year of business. I will now request Nilanjan to take the lead.  \",\n",

As illustrated in the investor presentation, the fall in the \\nmargin and outlook going forward has been explained by Shekhar and I will be touching upon \\ncertain specific highlights of our business. The net revenue from o perations for  FY'24 was at \\nINR2,415 crores, up by 15% year -on-year with EBITDA margin at 7.6%. Even though margins \\nhave been impacted, we have strong visibility for it to improve going forward.  \\n The company will have further incremental revenue in  FY'24 for additional INR230 crores as \\nthe full year benefit of the 2 additional 60 KLPD plant of Bengal and Jharkhand will be available \\nfor FY'25. In Q4, the company had capitalized 60 KLPD plants of both Bengal and Jharkhand. \\nIn April, company has all gone live and capitalized the UP bottling operation. The capitalization \\nof bottling plant in UP is a positive step to cater to the growing demand  of consumer business in \\nthe state.  \\nOur net debt of cash -- net of cash and cash equivalents at the end of FY'25 stands at INR241 \\ncrores, a slight increase versus  FY'23, which stood at INR194 crores. The increase in account of \\nincreased operations with new units and geographies opening up. Subsequent to the year -end, \\nthe company has received assessment orders of income tax. The amount of tax demand is \\nINR40.93 crores out of which INR5.3 crores was deposited in Q3.  \\nFor the balance amount, the company has deposited INR255.11 crores in protest and has gone \\nfor appeal. The company has evaluated the demand and based on external advice supporting \\ndocuments for the expenses and other available information, the management is of the view that \\nno provision is required at this s tage as it is probable, the company's position will be accepted \\nupon ultimate resolution. To conclude, we are hopeful of about upcoming quarters because of \\nthe initiatives that have been mentioned.  \\nWith this, I request the moderator to open the call for questions. Thank you.  \\nModerator:  Thank you very much. We will now begin the question -and-answer session. T he first question \\nis from the line of Madhur Rathi from Counter Cyclical investments.  \\nMadhur Rathi:  So when I come to our Prestige & Above segment, sir, our losses have been exceeding what our \\nrevenue growth has been. So we grew at 38% for year but our losses have exceeded 50%. So \\nwhy is that and when can we see the segment to be profitable as you have highlighted earlier as \\nthese are high gross margin segment. So if you could highlight on that?  \\nParamjit Gill:  Yes. Thanks for the question. So our losses are obviously we have our initial 5 states, and then \\nwe are expanding our presence. So we had entered 3 plus 2. So as we keep on feeding new \\nmarkets, the original markets will start reducing their losses tremendously and sta rts heading \\ntowards profitability. And we have a strategic choice to make the first 5 markets totally profitable \\nand then start the journey on the 6th and 7th market or as the first 2 markets start improving and \\nstart their journ ey towards profitability, and we see shoots of success of our strategy to start \\nfeeding the following markets.  \",\n",
       " \"                                         Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 5 of 22 \\n \\nHaving said that, we are still maintaining a view that annually, our investment in this business \\nwill be Circa INR25 crores or less. And that is what we are aiming for. And you will see going \\nforward, these numbers will start improving significantly northwards because the initial states \\nwill start kicking into performance and new state additions will start slowing dow n. So that's the \\nrationale for it.  \\nMadhur Rathi:  Sir, do we have some kind of timeline in our mind that like these states to be profitable in a year \\nor two, whatever timeline we have ? \\nParamjit Gill:  So the way we have intended going about is that every state between the third and the fourth \\nyear should start contributing to the bottom line. And we obviously see that our third year will \\nend at the end of this financial year and the fourth year will begin. So we are expec ting the initial \\nstates, to all of them, to start moving into the green zone between this year and next. And overall, \\nthis will start making the consumer business journey profitable. When we -- overall, as the \\nbottom line starts becoming profitable, I thin k it's probably a couple of years far from here as \\nwe see it because we also want to stay aggressive and improve our turnover and bottom lines \\naggressively rather than being very, very small and then trying to immediately make profit.  \\n So the losses in the current year are in line with our plans. As volumes are now scaling up to \\ncertain meaningful numbers, we'll see the losses reduce over the course of this year. Hopefully, \\nsometime next year, we will be in a breakeven position.  \\nMadhur Rathi:  Okay, sir. so that's very encouraging. Sir, my next question would be, sir, when you look at other \\nethanol as well as ENA manufacturers, sir, most of them are trying to establish their gin brand, \\nIMFL brand, whatever spirit brand they are trying to establi sh. Sir, how are you differentiating \\nourselves? And how are you placing our product in the market because one of our competitors \\nhas done this very well and got the valuation, we know how much. So how are we trying to get \\nthat gap reduced? An d what are our strategies in this segment, if you could help me understand?  \\nParamjit Gill:  So thanks for that. So we also have certain advantages for being later entrant because we have \\nthe advantage of being more innovative. We have the advantage of giving better offerings than \\nwhat are existing in the marketplace. So we are leaning on a combin ation of innovation, both in \\nliquid as well as packaging. And a couple of brands which are already in the marketplace have \\ndemonstrated it and that is on the back of this only you are seeing this robust growth coming \\nthrough.  \\nAnd we will continue to see ourselves use innovation, both in blends space where we are \\noperating as well as packaging to be a very strong factor for us as we move forward on that \\njourney. Obviously, these -- the new brands that we are entering now will ha ve a much sharper \\nbenefit because they will be able to ride on the route to market, which is already stabilizing as \\ncompared to earlier brands, the initial brands had to also parallelly create a route -to-market while \\nthey were planning to get distributed a nd sell -outs to take place. Does that answer your question?  \",\n",

Sir, what is the outlook for  FY'25 in terms of top line and \\nbottom line that you can give right now?  \\nShekhar Swarup : So we haven't given any outlook for top line or bottom line for the next financial year. Be that \\nas it may, we have given an expectation of segmental or category -wise performance. And a lot \\nof that is part of the deck, which has been uploaded today.  \\nModerator:  The next question is from the line of Parteek  from Kotak Bank.  \\nParteek : Sir, my first question is like our margins are in the range of 8% to 9%. So do we expect further \\ndrop in the margins?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  No, we don't expect further drop in margins. We are, in fact, expecting a growth in margins on \\nthe back of maize being the new maize crop and the success of maize for production of ethanol. \\nAlso our Regular & Others segment has been growing in profitability at 20% year -on-year, even \\nthough volumes are flat, we expect further growth in profitability as well as some growth in \\nvolumes in Regular & Others segment this year. In case of Prestige & Above, which is growing \\nat a very interesting rates, we expect our loss to reduce this  year overall, adding to profitability \\nof the company.  \\nParteek : And one more question. Like in the last few transcripts, we used to have a breakup of \\nmanufacturing revenue in form of bulk alcohol, franchise bottling and -- the sanitizer and other \\nsegments. So can I get the figures for these 3 things for this quarter?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  The sanitizer is practically 0. It has been for many quarters. Franchise revenue is a small part of \\nour bulk revenue. So we are not anymore reporting it separately, but the same proportion that \\nexisted last quarter will continue in Q4, we are no longer sep arating franchise bottling revenue \\nfrom bulk revenue. It is part of bulk business. And the bulk business performance has been \\nseparated from the consumer business performance very clearly in the deck.  \\nModerator:  The next question is from the line of Nitin Awasthi from InCred Equities.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  A few questions from my side. Firstly, on the operations front. Our plant in Uttar Pradesh, the \\nbottling plant. So it was ready and commissioned in April. Is that correct?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. We started bottling in April.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Okay. And from the UP bottling facility, we're going to cater to both the IMFL and the IMIL, is \\nthat understanding correct?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes, we are now sep arating these into 2 categories.  Regular & Others and Prestige & Above, all \\nthe entire portfolio of the company will be -- well, not the entire portfolio, but brands in regular \\nand others will be launched in UP as well as brands in Prestige & Above, which are already \\navailable in UP.  \",\n",
       " \"                                         Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 7 of 22 \\n \\nNitin Awasthi:  Okay. So as of now, this quarter, we have already launched all our regular and other brands in \\nUttar Pradesh.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Not yet, we will be launching it in this year.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Okay. So by when do we expect the consumer in UP to have our brands of Regular & Others \\nmanufactured in UP and ready to cater to them.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  I think Q2, Q3 is when you will have the launch of Regular & Others, sometime towards the end \\nof Q2, maybe beginning of Q3.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Understood, sir. And also within this facility, will we be importing our own ENA from our plants \\noutside the state? Or will it be open to purchase of ENA from other manufacturers within the \\nstate?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  It's a combination, it's based on quality and price. So it would be a combination of the two.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Understood, sir. So your RTD product, what is the current tax structure in the market that it is \\nintroduced? Is it similar to beer?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. Param, can I ask you to take that, please?  \\nParamjit Gill:  Yes. No, no, it is so our RTD offering, which we have initiated our entry into the business with, \\nit is a much stronger RTD. It has a strength, which is higher than that of a strong beer, and this \\nis a category that has been emerging, and we have -- on the back of our research, we have entered \\nthis category. So it is stronger than the normal strong beer.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Understood, sir. Sir, all I wanted to understand was the tax structure because I believe many \\nplayers...  \\nParamjit Gill:  It is different. So it is a third category, let's call it -- say that's a good way to put it.  No, RTD \\ncategory, it is a different tax structure, totally different tax structure.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Understood. Understood. And cost structure is similar to beer or even that is very different.  \\nParamjit Gill:  No, cost structure is also different.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  I can shed some light on the cost structure. So currently, this is a smaller scale production for \\nus. We are contract producing this in Himachal Pradesh at a winery under a winery license. So \\nit's a completely different product. It's a unique and innovativ e product that is being offered, UP \\nis the largest state for this category in India.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Understood, sir. Sir, lastly, on the JV within the beer segment, in the presentation, we have stated \\nthat we'll be starting sales via our introduction of product via outsourcing of manufacturing in \\nQ1 of a  FY'26. \",\n",
       " \"                                         Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 8 of 22 \\n \\nShekhar Swarup:  That's correct.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Okay so once we have our products in the market, we'd be probably the whole of  FY'26 would \\nbe testing around. Is that correct? And that would result in us taking the strategic decision of \\nmaking investments in brick -and-mortar, production houses and manufacturing facilities?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So I don't foresee an investment in a brewery in a hurry. When we get to a certain scale, and I \\nbelieve that scale is somewhere around 1 million to 2 million cases per annum of beer. That is \\nwhen a brewery investment starts making sense. So for a couple of  years at least, we're going to \\nstay as a contract brewed operation.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Understood, sir. Sir, last question on the financial front. All segments as reported within the deck \\nhave performed in line with expectations, except the Manufacturing segment because of the \\nheadwind faced on the raw material side. If you could just highli ght roughly what the spreads \\nwere on the gross level during the quarter? And what has it improved to?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Frankly, there were no spreads. That's why you saw the kind of performance that you see. In the \\nmiddle of the year, there was a complete sea change in raw material policy, which was \\ncompletely unexpected. Perhaps it was to do with the elections or some other reason, I'm not \\nsure, but it was an unprecedented decision.  \\nAs a result, it also happened at a time when the rice crop was coming in. So it led to a Q4 of \\nvery low raw material supplies available in the marketplace, which resulted in obviously price \\nincreases for commodities. What has happened coming into April and  May is that the maize crop \\ndue to the efforts of the company as well as others in the industry there was a huge amount of \\nfocus given to increasing maize cultivation in parts of North and East India. And a lot of that \\ncrop is now coming -- is now availabl e.  \\nThe harvest is happening now in May and in June. As a result, the industry has shifted its focus \\nfrom rice to maize, which is a more sustainable crop, I believe, for the future of ethanol in India. \\nSo as this change is playing out in May and June, we are s eeing recovery of margins, and we \\nhope, like I said in my opening remarks that this will continue. In fact, I believe that -- by the \\nend of this year, we will be back to our average level of margins that we have seen in the last \\nfew years, which is around INR7 per liter.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Understood, sir. So right now, we are at 100% maize for ENA and ethanol.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Not for ENA. For ethanol, we are using maize. For ENA, we continue to use rice.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Okay. But I think then there will be a renegotiation which would have happened with the \\nconsumers for absorbing the price rise on rice?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. So ENA business is great in that sense, right, because you were able to pass on your costs. \\nSo ENA business has remained in that manner. On the other hand, ethanol is a fixed price \\nbusiness. So we need to secure raw material suppliers. And that's why FCI made so much sense \",\n",
       " \"                                         Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 9 of 22 \\n \\nbecause it was a single -- it was a fixed price input and a fixed price output, but of course, that \\npolicy changed completely. And now we are pivoting to maize and over some time, we will be \\nable to even secure long -term pricing of maize because there are no intermediaries involved.  \\nModerator:  The next question is from the line of Imran from Longbow India Capital.  \\nImran:  My first question is on the manufacturing business. I think this time, you have not provided the \\nnumber of liters that you produced, right? Can you please mention that?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Sure, Nilanjan, do you have that ready.  \\nImran:  Let me go to the other question while Nilanjan is looking for it. The second question is on the \\nconsumer business. I think the realizations have dropped in this quarter. Is it fair to assume that \\nthe Value Plus segment has not performed as per the expectat ion and this is the reason of this \\ndrop in the realization?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So realization for Regular & others has been good. I think you might mean the realization drop \\nin Prestige & Above.  \\nImran:  Well, there is an overall average realization, if I just simply divide the consumer business by the \\nlakh cases, right?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So are you combining both the categories of Prestige & Regular?  \\nImran:  Everything combined.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. So fine. Okay. So the right way to look at this is to separate the 2 businesses, Regular & \\nOthers and Prestige & Above. Prestige & Above, and the reason we are separating these 2 is \\nbecause there's different stages of business that these 2 categories are at, Regular & Others is a \\nmore entrenched business with very high market shares, lower growth and good profitability, in \\nfact, increasing every year at a pretty good hit.  \\nOn the other hand, Prestige & Above is a new business, but I mentioned, it's 2 or 3 years at the \\nmost for our oldest markets and loss -making because we are investing money, but on the other \\nhand, a very high -growth business. Now Prestige & Above realizatio n per case has been \\nchanging from quarter to quarter.  \\nImran:  Realizations, it's not the profitability. Anyway, I think I understand what you're saying. Let me \\nmove to the other things because I think we are short of time here. I will just quickly ask you a \\ncouple of more questions on the -- first on the manufacturin g side. At this time, you have also \\nnot provided power and fuel cost, if you can do that, Nilanjan. And then the other question is, \\nwhich is the bigger question, this time, I think from the last quarter, there has been a INR70 \\ncrore s, INR80 crore s drop in the manufacturing business. So can you share the capacity \\nutilization and the reason for this drop?  \",\n",
       " \"                                         Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 10 of 22 \\n \\nShekhar Swarup:  We can share the capacity utilization and the production figures, no problem. The reason for \\ndrop is largely due to rice prices, as I mentioned earlier, we are now changing all of our ethanol \\nproduction to maize and we will see a change in margins coming i n on the bulk side as well.  \\nImran:  Right. And I think even in the last quarter, in last to last quarter, the broken rice prices were \\nsomewhere INR26 plus per kg, right? And if I just recollect, what my contacts have told me 10, \\n15 days back, that the rice prices are actually down about 10% in North India and about 15% in \\nthe East, specifically in West Bengal. Is it this information correct? And if s o how do you...  \\nShekhar Swarup:  I think the problem is the time periods you're looking at. You're absolutely right. The prices are \\ndown 10% to 15% today. In Q4, prices were up even more, we were looking at about INR29 to \\nINR30 per kg of rice in most parts of the country.  \\nImran:  But as we speak, I think it has cooled down to in West Bengal at least INR22, INR23 and in \\nRajasthan...  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. And I mentioned that in my opening remarks as well, that there has been softening of raw \\nmaterial prices in Q1.  \\nImran:  Right. And Shekhar, with this softening, I think it's a decent softening if we look at the impact, \\nI think INR4, INR5 on a minimum basis, right, on a per liter basis. So that will largely, I think \\nit will help you to gain more profitability in the consumer business, right? Because you will have \\nINR4, INR5 incremental price increase from April. And then on top of it, you will have this \\nanother INR4, INR5 per liter benefit of this raw material softening, right? So net -net, about \\nINR8, 10 on a liter bas is and maybe INR40 on a c hase basis.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Multiplied by about 3.5, not 4. But yes, you're right that there is a double impact of raw material \\nprice softening. It also improves profitability of our consumer business as well as improving \\nprofitability of our manufacturing business.  \\nImran:  And sorry, I forgot to thank you for giving this detailed, I think, breakup of consumer margins \\nand manufacturing margin. So very, very thankful for you to do this. I'll wait for Nilanjan to \\nmention… \\nNilanjan Sarkar:  I'll tell you, the production in Q4 has been 64.8 million liters. Our power and fuel cost for the \\nentire year has been INR245 crores.  \\nModerator:  The next question is from the line of Tushar Raghatate from Kamayakya Wealth Management \\nPrivate Limited.  \\nTushar Raghatate:  Just wanted to know, like  FY'24, what was our base as a percentage of the raw material market. \\nIn FY'25, how will you see that going forward?  \",\n",
       " \"                                         Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 11 of 22 \\n \\nShekhar Swarup:  Negligible. Last year, maize's usage was negligible. We started trials and change in processes in \\nQ4, but it was negligible, the amount of maize that was used. In this financial year, for ethanol, \\nwe expect over 2/3 of our ethanol production to come from m aize?  \\nTushar Raghatate:  Fair enough. So what sort of margin -- EBITDA margin gains are you looking for?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  We are targeting an average EBITDA margin of INR7 a liter. There will be periods of even \\nhigher margins, and there will be periods of even lower margins than INR7. However, an average \\nof INR7 is what our target is.  \\nTushar Raghatate:  Fair enough, sir. So the consumer business probably 19% EBITDA margin. Just wanted to know \\nwhat was the  FY'23 number for that? And how do you see that for  FY'25, I mean the country \\nliquor business.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. So Regular & Others, EBITDA has grown by 22% year -on-year.  \\nTushar Raghatate:  Sir, how do you see that for  FY'25? \\nShekhar Swarup:  We expect further growth because we have got price increases in Rajasthan as well as the -- as \\nwas being discussed earlier on this call with softening raw material prices, that impacts \\nprofitability in our consumer business as well.  \\nTushar Raghatate:  Okay. So are you seeing 200 basis point near to growth on that.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  It's difficult to say right now, but we've demonstrated 18% to 20% kind of growth in profitability \\nlast 2, 3 years in Our Regular & Others brands. I hope to continue this momentum.  \\nTushar Raghatate:  And sir, your new business, Not Out and the beer business, what sort of target revenue are you \\nseeing for the next 2 years?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  We are not breaking up revenue targets within our Prestige business into different brands. We \\nhave a target -- we have very aggressive targets. We have delivered, 85% year -on-year growth \\nand in Q4, over 150% growth. We hope to have very aggressive growth c ontinuing this year. \\nAnd then let's see how where we end up at the end of this year -- this is a small base, right? So \\nyou're going to get 3 -digit type of growth right now. Once the base becomes larger, this number \\nwill reduce.  \\nTushar Raghatate:  Fair enough. So then my last question, the recent capex which we did, what sort of incremental \\nrevenue will be seen in  FY'25? \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes, I don't have that number. But Nilanjan, do you have that number of bas is Bengal be \\nJharkhand, what will be the...  \\nNilanjan Sarkar:  Yes, Bengal and Jharkhand, 60 KLPD will give you an additional revenue of anything between \\nINR215 crores to INR230 crores.  \",\n",

And sir, the bottling will be over and above this, sir?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Bottling what, bottling in UP, you mean?  \\nTushar Raghatate:  Yes, yes, UP.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So that has already been accounted for when we spoke about volume growth of Prestige & \\nAbove as well as volume growth of Regular & Others. We are not going to be bottling brands \\nof other people. We are only going to bottle our own brands, yes.  \\nModerator:  The next question is from the line of Darshil Jhaveri from Crown Capital.  \\nDarshil Jhaveri:  Sir, some of my questions have already been answered. So just wanted to ask regarding our \\nPrestige & Other business . So our volumes are growing higher than our sales. So could you just \\nelaborate or give some more color on how is the price mix and product mix going out there?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So that is a stabilizing of our product mix that's taking place. It's a new business. Some brands \\nare growing faster than others. As you can see, there's been 170% volume growth in this period. \\nSo certain brands have outperformed other brands in this quart er. In the previous period, a higher \\nvalue brands were outperforming. So this a little bit of change in sales mix is going to happen. \\nIt will only be another year, year and a half before our average NSV, net sales value per case \\nsort of set tles down to a more reasonable number. For a year or 2, this number is going to be \\nfluctuating.  \\nNilanjan Sarkar:  Further to add  to Shekhar, the state mix also makes a difference to the revenue per case -- so \\nboth the combination of brands outperforming each other and the states outperforming each \\nother makes this thing.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Suffice it to say that the number to track for Prestige & Above is EBITDA growth as well as \\nvolume growth.  \\nDarshil Jhaveri:  Sir, we said EBITDA growth. So we said we are going to invest INR25 crores per year in \\nPrestige. So could we just see the losses reduced to that an EBITDA level? Or how would it \\nfunction in this current year, sir?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So I think what's going to happen in this year is that a large part of this loss is sales and \\ndistribution expenses as well as advertising and promotion. A lot of the sales and distribution \\ninfrastructure was created in advance before the volumes went up. So in some of the states where \\nvolumes are now becoming quite interesting, we are seeing sales and distribution costs dropped \\ndramatically because sales and distribution is not entirely a variable cost, most of it is fixed. \\nSimilarly, adver tising promotion is not a variable cost. Most of it is fixed. So as volumes go up, \\nyour profitability in state improves. So this year, we're going to start seeing a lot of this playing \\nout. Be that as it may, we'd also like to keep investing in growing new states and new states will \\ncontinue to bear losses. So over the next 12 to 24 months, we expect to be at a breakeven position \\nnet of all of this playing out.  \",\n",

So EBITDA level 12 to 24 months, that's what I said.  \\nModerator:  The next question is from the line of Sunny Gosar from MK  Ventures.  \\nSunny Gosar:  And thank you for the improved disclosure. So I had a  couple of questions. The first one is the \\n-- bulk alcohol production that you mentioned of 64.8 million cases, that would be including \\nwhat is used for country liquor, basically your Value and Value Plus product segment, right?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  64 million liters, not cases.  \\nNilanjan Sarkar:  Yes, liters.  \\nSunny Gosar:  64 million liters is including what is internally consumed for IMFL and country liquor.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. \\nNilanjan Sarkar:  Yes. \\nSunny Gosar:  What would be the bulk alcohol sales, say, in the form of ethanol or ENA?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Sales has been for Q4, 48 million liters -- 48.7 million liters.  \\nSunny Gosar:  Okay, okay. Got it. Got it. And my second question is on the profitability of the Bulk Alcohol \\nsegment, so you have reported manufacturing EBITDA of about INR3.6 crores. And if I divide \\nthat by, say, 48.7 million liters, that comes to less than INR1 per liter of EBITDA. So is there \\nany one -off cost in this quarter, which is taking the EBITDA per liter so low? Or how should we \\nread into this?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  If you're asking if there's an exceptional item or anything like that, there is no such thing. It is a \\nresult of raw material prices, the way they have moved in Q4 results -- the reason they have \\nmoved the way they have is because there was supply of rice c oming from FCI, which got \\nstopped abruptly. So all of the demand, which was with FCI then came into the open market in \\naddition to the regular open market demand of rice and that is what drove our prices of rice.  \",\n",
       " \"                                         Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 14 of 22 \\n \\n Going forward, we are now substituting rice with maize. The reason we could not substitute rice \\nwith maize earlier is because the crop of maize is a summer crop for North and East India. So \\ncrop has come now for the first time after the FCI banned supply o f rice for ethanol products.  \\nSunny Gosar:  So just 1 more question related to this. So in the last quarter, which is Q3  FY'24, you sold about \\n61 million liters of bulk alcohol, which has dropped to 48.7%. And is this because of demand \\nside challenges? Or is this because of our inability to supply because of lack of availability of \\nrice in the market?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So there's been some fluctuation during this period, which is largely to do with the changeover \\nfrom rice to maize. So that could also be playing a role in reduction of bulk sale. Nilanjan, do \\nyou have an analysis ready for that?  \\nNilanjan Sarkar:  No, what you said is correct. And to some extent, some lower capacity utilization in 2 of our \\nplants. So that has come back to normal now, but lower capacity in 2 of our plants.  \\nSunny Gosar:  Got it. Going forward, basically adjusted for the internal consumption for your IMFL and IMIL \\nsegment, how much volume of bulk alcohol can we sell on a quarterly basis with all the full \\ncapacity with Jharkhand and all the capacity having come...  \\nShekhar Swarup:  We can sell all of our surplus.  \\nSunny Gosar:  But That would be about 55 million liters or 60 million liters...  \\nShekhar Swarup:  I haven't computed the surplus. But on the demand side, there is no concern, really, especially \\nbecause of ethanol. Even if there is fluctuation, seasonal fluctuation that happens from time to \\ntime in our consumer business, where bulk alcohol sale increase s a little bit. There is no problem \\non the demand side for ethanol.  \\nSunny Gosar:  Got it. And 1 last question. On the IMIL side, basically, while we have seen so much pressure \\nof the raw material on the Bulk Alcohol segment, we have been able to increase our EBITDA \\nper case on a Y -o-Y basis from INR75 to INR85 in Q4  FY'24 in spite of a drop in realization. I \\nbelieve the raw material pressure would be equally there on the IMIL segment or, right? So in \\nthat segment, how have we been able to improve our EBITDA margin in such a...  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So there has been better purchasing that was done, improved costing in terms of specifications \\nof materials, in terms of better purchasing decisions, which has helped ease of or rather improve \\nmargins in Regular & Others. And since the company has such a s cale, we are able to really do \\nsome intelligent purchasing of packing material now.  \\nSunny Gosar:  But sir, on a Y -o-Y basis, we have seen moderation in realization per case, but -- and we would \\nhave seen a significant jump in your raw material cost per case, right, because of the increase in \\nrice prices.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  No. So I don't follow what you're saying. There has been an increase...  \",\n",
       " \"                                         Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 15 of 22 \\n \\nSunny Gosar:  EBITDA per liter on the Bulk Alcohol segment has gone from INR12.5 in Q4  FY'23 to INR0.74 \\nper liter.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. \\nSunny Gosar:  Based on whatever reported -- segmental reported numbers that you've given...  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes, yes.  \\nSunny Gosar:  But on the contrary, our IMIL EBITDA per case has increased from INR75 per case to INR85 \\nper case. And I believe the raw material cost pressure, mainly the rice related pressure will be \\nsimilar on both the segments.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Sir, there are 3 components to the consumer business: one is selling price; second is packing \\nmaterial costs; and third is raw material cost. Raw material costs went up. Packing material \\nprices came down because of better purchasing and selling price went up. \\nSunny Gosar:  Maybe I can take it offline because your realization per case has dropped. So I was wondering \\nthat if the selling prices have gone up, how would your realization per case -- maybe we can \\ndiscuss this offline.  \\nNilanjan Sarkar:  The realization per case has not dropped.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  It has gone up. That's what I'm saying. I don't know what number you're looking at.  \\nSunny Gosar:  I just divided the country Value Plus revenue divided by the Value Plus number of cases that's \\ncoming to INR513 for this quarter versus INR528 for the previous quarter.  \\nNilanjan Sarkar:  We'll have to get back to the calculation. But the realization per case has not dropped.  \\nSunny Gosar:  Sure.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Let's take this offline. Yes, I'm not so sure what you're looking at there.  \\nModerator:  The next question is from the line of Nirav Seksaria from Living Root Analytics.  \\nNirav Seksaria:  So sir, What kind of brands are we looking forward to add in Prestige & Above because going \\nforward, that's going to drive us a better revenue and gross margin in the future?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So on our deck, we have a slide where we have shown the different categories of brands that are \\nbeing launched, please do refer to that. It has a lot of detail in terms of price point and flavor \\nsegment.  \\nNirav Seksaria:  I'm referring to that. But to follow up on that question, so we are adding 3 new brands when it \\ncomes to Prestige & Above whereas we added 4 to 5 new brands in Regular & Others, which is \",\n",
       " \"                                         Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 16 of 22 \\n \\nrelatively a lower margin business for us with relatively less pricing power.  Sir, any specific \\nreason why  \\nShekhar Swarup:  There are 2 brands in Regular & Others and 5 brands in Prestige & Above.  \\nNirav Seksaria:  Sir, are we adding new SKUs in each particular segments?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  No, these are new brands.  \\nParamjit Gill:  So SKUs adding is not counted here. These are new brands, not SKUs.  \\nNirav Seksaria:  Okay, sure. And what kind of initiatives are we taking to increase our brand awareness in such \\nmarkets?  \\nParamjit Gill:  So we have already started. I mean, we can't get into too many details. But in addition to \\nwhatever efforts we make at the marketplace knowing the limitations, obviously, within the \\nlimitations of that, digital marketing is also happening on in relevant ca tegories and relevant \\ngeographies. But as I said, there are limitations to what one can do. And within the framework, \\nwe are, as of now, slowly expanding into the 360 for the brand should get supported by in \\naddition to its presence at the s helf. \\nNirav Seksaria:  And going forward, any -- could you name out the next states that you are, guys, planning to \\nenter into?  \\nParamjit Gill:  We, as a principle, do not share in advance. As soon as the state happens, we do share. So I have \\ncalled out that we are planning to expand in 2 more states in this financial year, and we would \\nvery keenly share with the details with you as soon as it happ ens, knowing that we are operating \\nin a certain environment.  \\nModerator:  The next question is from the line of Dhruv Kashyap , who is an individual investor.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So this is a slightly more philosophical than a sort of 32,000 -feet above sea level question and \\nShekhar, addressed to you. So see, if you look at the landscape around you. And if you leave \\naside the sort of large multinational players, so in the more sort  of the challenger player, you \\nwould see that the guys who have really built consumer brands are the guys who are \\ncommanding sort of value, right? So if you look at Radico Khaitan or you now look at what \\nPiccadily has done with Indri, right?   \\nSo I always wanted to understand this to you that for a INR2,000 crore s, INR3,000 crore s \\nbusiness, we have amazing amount of complexity, right? And generally, the smaller the \\nbusiness, the lesser the complexity, the more focused on the target of sort of getting entrenched \\ninto the consumer space and really sort of commanding that value. So I' m just trying to \\nunderstand from you that we do this ENA, we do sort of ethanol, we do IMIL, we do IMFL and \\nwhen times go bad, like we are going through a vicious cycle and not a virtuous cycle in the last \\n2, 3 years, all the 4 sort of pillars come collaps ing down.  \",\n",
       " \"                                         Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 17 of 22 \\n \\nSo I mean, what's your thought in terms of are we really looking at becoming a 100% consumer \\nfranchise someday? Or we always remain part of contract manufacturing; part sort of \\nmanufacturing; part consumer; part IMFL; part IMIL because I don't see how valu e will come \\nto such complexities. Mostly value has been created by very single -minded focus on building \\nbrands in this alcobev space in India.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So firstly, thanks for the question. I do not agree that all 4 pillars, like you said, have come \\ncrashing down. I think the Regular & Others business has been growing very well in terms of \\nprofitability and volumes. Even though it is a high -volume business  now with low growth, I'm \\npretty happy the way it is shaping up. The Prestige & Above business is a new business, the -- \\nall the state, we entered just over 2 years ago coming in on 3 years. That 2 brands over there \\nhave done exceedingly we ll currently, and we are hoping to increase our portfolio in this year.  \\n You're right about the margin erosion that has taken place in the Bulk business, but that is \\nsomething that is, how do I say, part of the gain. I have always maintained that margins in that \\nbusiness will go up and down. But our average of around INR7 a liter EBITDA margin is \\nsomething that we have been maintaining and we will continue to maintain. You have periods \\nwhere the number is closer to INR15, and you'll have periods where the number is closer to \\nINR2 or INR1.  \\nBut you will have an average of INR7, the combination of our Bulk business as well as our \\nRegular & Others business gives us the cash to be able to invest in the Prestige & Above \\nbusiness. the objective of Globus Spirits, of the management here is to be able to build an even \\nbigger consumer  franchise without diluting any equity without raising any funds for that journey. \\nI hope I've been able to put my philosophy clearly.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So I'm just trying to summarize what you said. You're saying that, one kind of gives you the \\nfunds to sort of really build the other? I'm just trying to simplify what you said. Yes So \\nphilosophically, then we are not very different where you are saying tha t ultimately, the objective \\nis to fuel growth in the consumer business by funding it.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. \\nDhruv Kashyap : Right. So the manufacturing business is not a means to an end. So ultimately, you would also be \\nhappy if you're sitting on a couple of INR1,000 crores, INR2,000 crores brands.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. \\nDhruv Kashyap : Yes. So that way you're just talking about this -- so you're just talking about the means to the \\nend being slightly different, but the endpoint is pretty much same in what both of us are talking. \\nAnd hence, the time lines and all might be different. But bo ttom line is you are not in a very \\ndifferent space from what I just said.  \",\n",
       " \"                                         Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 18 of 22 \\n \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. Yes. I mean our focus is building a consumer business. The cash for building that consumer \\nbusiness comes from Regular & Others and comes from the Bulk business.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : And you don't think there's too much of complexity in the end points. You're trying to build \\nIMIL, regular, Value Plus, IMFL then the Craft segment, the craft whiskey, craft gin. Is that not \\ntoo complex to build us, I mean...  \\nShekhar Swarup:  No, we don't think it's too complicated.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : That's not the way most other guys are going, right? The other guys are trying to get wins in 1 \\nor 2 big categories?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So okay, let's just talk about the other guys for a minute, okay? The other guys have achieved \\ncertain wins. So they talk about those wins. They do not talk about the journey. In case of Globus \\nSpirits, we are on that journey, and we are talking to you abo ut how we are on that journey. Our \\nwins have been in setting up a solid Regular & Other franchise. Our wins has been in setting up \\nreally good assets cheaply and being able to operate really well. Those are our wins -- those are \\nour wins cu rrently.  \\nWhen it comes to Prestige & Above, we are very much on the journey right now. And for me to \\ntalk about just SNOSKI, for example, is insufficient because SNOSKI is one part of our journey \\nright now. Maybe 2 or 3 years down, when we've got 8 to 10 brands, we  are not launching any \\nmore brands, out of these 8 to 10 brands, you've got 3 brands that are more successful than the \\nothers, then we just talk about those successes.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So you're saying that ultimately, a good presence in sort of that craft or -- sort of Indian made \\nsort of nice whiskeys and gins and all then there would be something in the sort of regular IMFL \\nspace, there will be something in the IMIL. But ultimately, y ou also see that a few years down \\nthe line, there will be 1, 2, 3 big wins, which will be our big business drivers. I'm talking about \\nconsumer brands, sorry, just to be clear.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Absolutely.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So that's what I just want to understand that are we sort of aligned because I've been invested for \\na long time, but I wasn't sure whether you're aligned on the philosophy. So that's great. So that's \\none piece of clarity. The second one was on the manufact uring...  \\nModerator:  Sorry to interrupt you, sir. May I request you to please follow the queue?  \\nDhruv Kashyap : I just asked one question . Yes. So the second question was that on the manufacturing side. And \\nI'm just trying to understand this. So if it's been covered or if it's irritating, you can stop me, but \\nmost of my understanding, you have a significant presence in the East, right? And yo u've been \\nexpanding capacities there as well. And then you have a presence in the north. Now what I \\nunderstand from you is that very soon, we'll be moving all of ethanol to corn or maize, right? \",\n",
       " \"                                         Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 19 of 22 \\n \\nNow is that predominantly East? Or would you -- or do we not manufacture any ethanol at all in \\nthe north?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  North manufacturing of ethanol is very small. It's only about 70,000 or 80,000 liters per day in \\nHaryana. So yes, I mean, if we were manufacturing more ethanol in the north, we would have \\nlooked at maize in the north as well. But we are able to get enough rice at a decent cost for that \\nsmall capacity. So I'm not shifting to maize in the north.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So it would be fair to say that your ethanol is -- maybe 70%, 80% plus is coming from the East.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. \\nDhruv Kashyap : Maybe even more, right?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Maybe even more.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So in which case, you are saying that whole thing will move over to maize, and there should be \\na more sort of sustained supply as well given the government initiatives, and I'm told IIT is \\ntrying to get some new seeds, et cetera, which gives you a better yield. So with all that focus, \\nand all the politicians have been going around saying that they are growing oil crops and not \\nfood crops anymore. I'm told there's a lot of effort. Now with all of that,  wouldn't the cost of \\nENA come down significantly from where we are today?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Cost of ENA or ethanol?  \\nDhruv Kashyap : Sorry, cost of manufacturing ethanol, sorry, my mistake.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes, that is what we are seeing. You're absolutely right. There is a lot of focus on maize. Maize \\nbecause there are no intermediaries, there's no rice mills, we are able to contract long term for \\nmaize supplies. It's not -- we're not fully there yet on mai ze. This is the first Season of maize -- \\nor the first -- rather sustained period of maize ethanol supplies in India, it will take maybe 1 or \\n2 maize crop seasons for us to complete that whole journey. But yes, the journey is very exciting.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So just to understand this with an example, I mean just given -- you might not want to share \\nexact figures, but ballpark, what was the maize procurement price before and what is it now? \\nBallpark. I mean, don't need to be exact.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So the procurement price is not as relevant as the margin per liter because the price has gone up \\nyear-on-year but so has the ethanol price year -on-year.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : Yes. So that's also gone up from 56% to almost 72% now. So I just want to understand the \\nmargin, sorry, not the … \\nShekhar Swarup:  So in the past, it was not whatever it was 58% or whatever the old number was. It was not viable \\nto make ethanol from maize at all. But at the INR71.8 or INR72 level that we are at today, a \",\n",
       " \"                                         Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 20 of 22 \\n \\nINR7 per liter average margin is very much possible. We've seen periods already in Q1, and I'm \\ntalking about very short periods, obviously, where the margins are even greater than INR10 a \\nliter. Okay. So that's why I keep coming back to this, that the average margins with maize, I \\nbelieve, now are very much possible to be at around INR7 a liter.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : And just a quick follow -up on that, that maize procurement would be what now, about INR21, \\nINR22 a kg? Or is it more, is it less?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  It's between INR22 and INR24. \\nDhruv Kashyap : Okay. So that means it hasn't come down at all because wasn't it about INR24 last quarter as \\nwell?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  No, it was INR26, INR25. \\nDhruv Kashyap : So it has come down. Okay. And hence, my last -- so you're saying it's between INR22 to INR24 \\nnow. And irrespective of that, given the INR72 a liter given the throughput, et cetera, and Globus \\nalways has a better throughput than the rest of the industry in terms of conversion. My guess is \\nthat, that INR7 a liter should be doable, maybe even more or less at times. That's what you're \\nsaying.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  INR7 Is an average that we are shooting for, yes.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : And you said that there are sometimes in Q1, you got INR10 also, sometimes you'll get below, \\nbut INR7-plus shouldn't be a big challenge in the medium term is what you're saying, yes?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. \\nDhruv Kashyap : And my last question was, sir, on the rice part. What is the rice procurement price now versus \\nearlier?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Rice has become much cheaper now as compared to Q4. So at the current level of rice and maize, \\nit's equal profitability. But we are supporting maize cultivation, et cetera, because maize is a \\nmuch better crop for ethanol going forward.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So if I've understood you correctly, at INR64 a liter at which the OMCs buy from you, and at \\nwhatever price you're buying rice versus INR72 a liter they procure from you and at INR22 to \\nINR24 that you're buying maize, the profitability is almost the same?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. Rice much cheaper to convert.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : Yes. Because I think the throughput is there are about 440 to 460 liters versus, I think maize is \\nabout 385, 390 or thereabout, right? So there's almost a 15% or 20% extra throughput that you \\nget from your rice conversion.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. \",\n",
       " \"                                         Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 21 of 22 \\n \\nDhruv Kashyap : So would you be able to help me with the rice price earlier versus now that you're procuring it?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So in the East, we're not really buying too much rice. It's around INR24, INR25 right  in the East.  \\nNilanjan Sarkar:  Yes, yes. Yes.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : And is it any different in the North or is it the same?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  INR23, INR24, north is a little bit cheaper right now.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So ballpark INR23 to INR25, if I talk about the whole country average versus it was about \\nINR27, INR28, INR29 earlier, right?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  INR29, INR28 in Q4.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So that's almost a 15%, 20% cooling off of the prices.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. \\nModerator:  The next question is from the line of Munjal Shah , who is an individual investor.  \\nMunjal Shah : Shekhar, it might be a repetitive question. I just wanted to understand when you mentioned that \\nyou were excited about maize being the raw material for ethanol than rice. Can you just throw \\nsome light on why -- like what was the difference? So I understand  the conversion of rice is \\nmuch faster than maize. But why maize would be better going forward. If you can just help me \\nunderstand?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So there are 2 reasons. One is that in terms of maize cultivation and rice cultivation, maize uses \\nfar less water as compared to rice and from an environmental standpoint, it's obviously much \\nbetter for the country. Second is that we use broken rice, which  is about 7% of the total rice \\nproduction. Rice production itself is only about 67% of the total paddy harvest, so in effect, we \\nuse maybe, what, 5% of the total crop by weight. So if you look at the yield of ethanol per acre, \\nin terms of m aize and rice, maize is far superior.  \\nAs a result, the number of farmers, the amount of land area required for cultivation is -- for \\nethanol -- for our ethanol capacity is much lower. But the most interesting thing, frankly, is that \\nmaize is a crop that is not purchased by the Government of In dia. It is not purchased by -- it is \\nnot produced by intermediaries such as rice mills. And as a result, it can be a direct farmer to \\nfactory kind of model. And for that reason, we are very excited about it.  \\nModerator:  Ladies and gentlemen, we will take that as a last question. I'd now like to hand the conference \\nover to Mr. Shekhar Swarup for closing comments.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Thank you very much for your time and your questions. In case there are questions we are not \\nable to answer, please reach out to us, to Nilanjan or to the Investor Relations team, and we'll do \\nour best to get back to you. Thank you very much.  \",\n",

As a reminder, all participant lines will be in listen -only mode, and \\nthere will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should \\nyou need assistance during the conference call, please signal an operator by pressing star,  then \\nzero on your touchtone phone.  Please note that this conference is being recorded.  \\n I now hand the conference over to Mr. Shekhar Swarup, Joint Managing Director from Globus \\nSpirits Limited. Thank you, and over to you, sir.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q4 and FY'24 Earnings Call . Our \\npresentation has been uploaded on the exchange, and I hope you had a chance to go through it. \\nThere's been some technical difficulties with the network and the servers to upload the results. \\nI'm informed that that's happening right now. And I apologi ze for the inconvenience caused. \\nMeanwhile, I will go ahead with the opening remarks to this call.  \\n In this quarter onwards, we now are analyzing our performance separately for our brands as well \\nas manufacturing business. In the presentation that was uploaded, you would have found a \\ndifferent way of analyzing the performance and I hope you will continue  to find it useful in the \\nquarters to come.  \\nIn Q4 FY'24, we saw unprecedented low margin due to a change in the raw material mix as FCI \\ndiscontinued rice supplies for manufacturing of bulk alcohol. If you recall, the stop had taken \\nplace in August of 2023. And in this period, we have bridged the gap  in raw material supplies \\nlargely with rice purchased from the open market and the margin for this product was very low \\nin this quarter gone by.  \\nWe are, however, now  very excited about the prospects of using maize for ethanol with a higher \\nrealization for final product, which is ethanol, better by -products yield and a better \\nenvironmental footprint. Maize is quite possibly the correct crop for ethanol production in Ind ia.  \\nWith maize, the company can also reduce dependence on intermediaries such as rice mills. And \\nwe hope that in the next 1 or 2  years, we will be able to secure long -term pricing for maize, in \\nline with ethanol orders and hope to eliminate volatility in margins altogether.  \\nGoing forward, we believe that the bulk business, which is a combination of ENA and ethanol, \\nour EBITDA margins in this business will be at around INR7 a liter. We will see periods of high \\nmargins as well as periods of low margins. But as an average of cyc le, INR7 per liter of EBITDA \\nmargin is something I believe the company will achieve. In fact, we are already seeing a positive \\nchange towards this direction in Q1 on the back of maize, as I explained earlier.  \\n After certain pending regulatory approvals were complete in Q4, our total installed capacity \\npending regulatory approvals for Jharkhand and West Bengal expansion that is, our total \\ninstalled capacity now stands at 300 million liters per year. And more recently, in Q1, we have                                          Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 3 of 22 \\n \\ncommenced the commercial production of our bottling unit at Lakhimpur, UP, and we're very \\nexcited about the prospects of launching our entire range of brands in Uttar Pradesh.  \\nWe also recently announced a joint venture partnership with ANSA McAL, a diverse \\nconglomerate with rich Caribbean history. The objective of this venture is to engage in the \\ndistribution, marketing and manufacturing of Carib Beer in India. Carib Beer is a trademark \\nowned by ANSA McAL and is a very popular beer in parts of the world. We plan to contract \\nmanufacture the beer in India to start with, and we expect launch in Q1 of FY'26.  \\n I request Param to provide an update on the consumer business.  \\nParamjit Gill:  Thank you, Shekhar. Good afternoon, everyone. Coming to our high -growth Prestige & Above \\nsegment , for the quarter gone by, we witnessed a sales volume of 0.13 million cases with a \\ngrowth of 170%. For the full year, also the performance has been robust. Our full year volumes \\nstood at 0.38 million cases with a growth of 84% year -on-year. We continue to ex pect strong \\ngrowth even in the current financial year on this account, and we expect profitability to improve \\nfurther as the volume growth con tinue to come in and the route -to-market efficiencies start \\nkicking in through some of the early states.  \\n In the next couple of quarters, we obviously want to plan to launch a few new and innovative \\nbrands across some exciting categories as well. These brands will ride on the route -to-market \\nstrength that we have created in the first few states and the partner ships set us by us successfully \\nso far. We are also going to be expanding our distribution presence, which currently stands at 6 \\nstates to another 2 states during the coming quarters.  \\n Coming to Regular & Others segment. We continue to perform well for the company with a total \\nvolume of 3.43 million and a growth of 8% year -on-year and total profitability of INR292 \\nmillion, with a growth of 21% year -on-year. For the full year, this number of volume stands at \\n14.16 million and profitability at INR1,404 million with 22% year -on-year growth. The Regular \\n& Others is an entrenched mature business with high market shares in Rajasthan.  \\nWe are planning to enter this segment in UP in the coming quarter. And this state is a sizable \\nopportunity, and we are very excited about the possibilities that this will create for us. Our recent \\nbrand launches of Mountain Oak and SNOSKI Vodka in the Pres tige & Above segment have \\nbeen very well received across markets. These 2 brands are going to get expanded into the \\nbalanced markets as we start getting approvals from excise in the new policies.  \\n Our latest offering of RTD, which is named Not Out has just been launched in Delhi and the \\ninitial prospects are encouraging. And we will see through its further expansion in the coming \\nquarters to the second and the third states. As you will note that the  green shoots of our strategy \\nto strengthen our market capability first state by state and then riding on it with an array of \\nbrands to succeed is now you'd seem to be yielding results. And I'm very happy to share that 3 \\nout of the first choice of 5 state s are in a good position to start benefiting from this strategy as \\nwe have entered our third year of business. I will now request Nilanjan to take the lead.                                           Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 4 of 22 \\n \\n Nilanjan Sarkar:  Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. As illustrated in the investor presentation, the fall in the \\nmargin and outlook going forward has been explained by Shekhar and I will be touching upon \\ncertain specific highlights of our business. The net revenue from o perations for  FY'24 was at \\nINR2,415 crores, up by 15% year -on-year with EBITDA margin at 7.6%. Even though margins \\nhave been impacted, we have strong visibility for it to improve going forward.  \\n The company will have further incremental revenue in  FY'24 for additional INR230 crores as \\nthe full year benefit of the 2 additional 60 KLPD plant of Bengal and Jharkhand will be available \\nfor FY'25. In Q4, the company had capitalized 60 KLPD plants of both Bengal and Jharkhand. \\nIn April, company has all gone live and capitalized the UP bottling operation. The capitalization \\nof bottling plant in UP is a positive step to cater to the growing demand  of consumer business in \\nthe state.  \\nOur net debt of cash -- net of cash and cash equivalents at the end of FY'25 stands at INR241 \\ncrores, a slight increase versus  FY'23, which stood at INR194 crores. The increase in account of \\nincreased operations with new units and geographies opening up. Subsequent to the year -end, \\nthe company has received assessment orders of income tax. The amount of tax demand is \\nINR40.93 crores out of which INR5.3 crores was deposited in Q3.  \\nFor the balance amount, the company has deposited INR255.11 crores in protest and has gone \\nfor appeal. The company has evaluated the demand and based on external advice supporting \\ndocuments for the expenses and other available information, the management is of the view that \\nno provision is required at this s tage as it is probable, the company's position will be accepted \\nupon ultimate resolution. To conclude, we are hopeful of about upcoming quarters because of \\nthe initiatives that have been mentioned.  \\nWith this, I request the moderator to open the call for questions. Thank you.  \\nModerator:  Thank you very much. We will now begin the question -and-answer session. T he first question \\nis from the line of Madhur Rathi from Counter Cyclical investments.  \\nMadhur Rathi:  So when I come to our Prestige & Above segment, sir, our losses have been exceeding what our \\nrevenue growth has been. So we grew at 38% for year but our losses have exceeded 50%. So \\nwhy is that and when can we see the segment to be profitable as you have highlighted earlier as \\nthese are high gross margin segment. So if you could highlight on that?  \\nParamjit Gill:  Yes. Thanks for the question. So our losses are obviously we have our initial 5 states, and then \\nwe are expanding our presence. So we had entered 3 plus 2. So as we keep on feeding new \\nmarkets, the original markets will start reducing their losses tremendously and sta rts heading \\ntowards profitability. And we have a strategic choice to make the first 5 markets totally profitable \\nand then start the journey on the 6th and 7th market or as the first 2 markets start improving and \\nstart their journ ey towards profitability, and we see shoots of success of our strategy to start \\nfeeding the following markets.                                           Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 5 of 22 \\n \\nHaving said that, we are still maintaining a view that annually, our investment in this business \\nwill be Circa INR25 crores or less. And that is what we are aiming for. And you will see going \\nforward, these numbers will start improving significantly northwards because the initial states \\nwill start kicking into performance and new state additions will start slowing dow n. So that's the \\nrationale for it.  \\nMadhur Rathi:  Sir, do we have some kind of timeline in our mind that like these states to be profitable in a year \\nor two, whatever timeline we have ? \\nParamjit Gill:  So the way we have intended going about is that every state between the third and the fourth \\nyear should start contributing to the bottom line. And we obviously see that our third year will \\nend at the end of this financial year and the fourth year will begin. So we are expec ting the initial \\nstates, to all of them, to start moving into the green zone between this year and next. And overall, \\nthis will start making the consumer business journey profitable. When we -- overall, as the \\nbottom line starts becoming profitable, I thin k it's probably a couple of years far from here as \\nwe see it because we also want to stay aggressive and improve our turnover and bottom lines \\naggressively rather than being very, very small and then trying to immediately make profit.  \\n So the losses in the current year are in line with our plans. As volumes are now scaling up to \\ncertain meaningful numbers, we'll see the losses reduce over the course of this year. Hopefully, \\nsometime next year, we will be in a breakeven position.  \\nMadhur Rathi:  Okay, sir. so that's very encouraging. Sir, my next question would be, sir, when you look at other \\nethanol as well as ENA manufacturers, sir, most of them are trying to establish their gin brand, \\nIMFL brand, whatever spirit brand they are trying to establi sh. Sir, how are you differentiating \\nourselves? And how are you placing our product in the market because one of our competitors \\nhas done this very well and got the valuation, we know how much. So how are we trying to get \\nthat gap reduced? An d what are our strategies in this segment, if you could help me understand?  \\nParamjit Gill:  So thanks for that. So we also have certain advantages for being later entrant because we have \\nthe advantage of being more innovative. We have the advantage of giving better offerings than \\nwhat are existing in the marketplace. So we are leaning on a combin ation of innovation, both in \\nliquid as well as packaging. And a couple of brands which are already in the marketplace have \\ndemonstrated it and that is on the back of this only you are seeing this robust growth coming \\nthrough.  \\nAnd we will continue to see ourselves use innovation, both in blends space where we are \\noperating as well as packaging to be a very strong factor for us as we move forward on that \\njourney. Obviously, these -- the new brands that we are entering now will ha ve a much sharper \\nbenefit because they will be able to ride on the route to market, which is already stabilizing as \\ncompared to earlier brands, the initial brands had to also parallelly create a route -to-market while \\nthey were planning to get distributed a nd sell -outs to take place. Does that answer your question?                                           Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 6 of 22 \\n \\nMadhur Rathi:  Yes, sir. Sir, just the final question. Sir, what is the outlook for  FY'25 in terms of top line and \\nbottom line that you can give right now?  \\nShekhar Swarup : So we haven't given any outlook for top line or bottom line for the next financial year. Be that \\nas it may, we have given an expectation of segmental or category -wise performance. And a lot \\nof that is part of the deck, which has been uploaded today.  \\nModerator:  The next question is from the line of Parteek  from Kotak Bank.  \\nParteek : Sir, my first question is like our margins are in the range of 8% to 9%. So do we expect further \\ndrop in the margins?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  No, we don't expect further drop in margins. We are, in fact, expecting a growth in margins on \\nthe back of maize being the new maize crop and the success of maize for production of ethanol. \\nAlso our Regular & Others segment has been growing in profitability at 20% year -on-year, even \\nthough volumes are flat, we expect further growth in profitability as well as some growth in \\nvolumes in Regular & Others segment this year. In case of Prestige & Above, which is growing \\nat a very interesting rates, we expect our loss to reduce this  year overall, adding to profitability \\nof the company.  \\nParteek : And one more question. Like in the last few transcripts, we used to have a breakup of \\nmanufacturing revenue in form of bulk alcohol, franchise bottling and -- the sanitizer and other \\nsegments. So can I get the figures for these 3 things for this quarter?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  The sanitizer is practically 0. It has been for many quarters. Franchise revenue is a small part of \\nour bulk revenue. So we are not anymore reporting it separately, but the same proportion that \\nexisted last quarter will continue in Q4, we are no longer sep arating franchise bottling revenue \\nfrom bulk revenue. It is part of bulk business. And the bulk business performance has been \\nseparated from the consumer business performance very clearly in the deck.  \\nModerator:  The next question is from the line of Nitin Awasthi from InCred Equities.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  A few questions from my side. Firstly, on the operations front. Our plant in Uttar Pradesh, the \\nbottling plant. So it was ready and commissioned in April. Is that correct?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. We started bottling in April.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Okay. And from the UP bottling facility, we're going to cater to both the IMFL and the IMIL, is \\nthat understanding correct?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes, we are now sep arating these into 2 categories.  Regular & Others and Prestige & Above, all \\nthe entire portfolio of the company will be -- well, not the entire portfolio, but brands in regular \\nand others will be launched in UP as well as brands in Prestige & Above, which are already \\navailable in UP.                                           Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 7 of 22 \\n \\nNitin Awasthi:  Okay. So as of now, this quarter, we have already launched all our regular and other brands in \\nUttar Pradesh.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Not yet, we will be launching it in this year.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Okay. So by when do we expect the consumer in UP to have our brands of Regular & Others \\nmanufactured in UP and ready to cater to them.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  I think Q2, Q3 is when you will have the launch of Regular & Others, sometime towards the end \\nof Q2, maybe beginning of Q3.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Understood, sir. And also within this facility, will we be importing our own ENA from our plants \\noutside the state? Or will it be open to purchase of ENA from other manufacturers within the \\nstate?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  It's a combination, it's based on quality and price. So it would be a combination of the two.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Understood, sir. So your RTD product, what is the current tax structure in the market that it is \\nintroduced? Is it similar to beer?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. Param, can I ask you to take that, please?  \\nParamjit Gill:  Yes. No, no, it is so our RTD offering, which we have initiated our entry into the business with, \\nit is a much stronger RTD. It has a strength, which is higher than that of a strong beer, and this \\nis a category that has been emerging, and we have -- on the back of our research, we have entered \\nthis category. So it is stronger than the normal strong beer.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Understood, sir. Sir, all I wanted to understand was the tax structure because I believe many \\nplayers...  \\nParamjit Gill:  It is different. So it is a third category, let's call it -- say that's a good way to put it.  No, RTD \\ncategory, it is a different tax structure, totally different tax structure.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Understood. Understood. And cost structure is similar to beer or even that is very different.  \\nParamjit Gill:  No, cost structure is also different.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  I can shed some light on the cost structure. So currently, this is a smaller scale production for \\nus. We are contract producing this in Himachal Pradesh at a winery under a winery license. So \\nit's a completely different product. It's a unique and innovativ e product that is being offered, UP \\nis the largest state for this category in India.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Understood, sir. Sir, lastly, on the JV within the beer segment, in the presentation, we have stated \\nthat we'll be starting sales via our introduction of product via outsourcing of manufacturing in \\nQ1 of a  FY'26.                                          Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 8 of 22 \\n \\nShekhar Swarup:  That's correct.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Okay so once we have our products in the market, we'd be probably the whole of  FY'26 would \\nbe testing around. Is that correct? And that would result in us taking the strategic decision of \\nmaking investments in brick -and-mortar, production houses and manufacturing facilities?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So I don't foresee an investment in a brewery in a hurry. When we get to a certain scale, and I \\nbelieve that scale is somewhere around 1 million to 2 million cases per annum of beer. That is \\nwhen a brewery investment starts making sense. So for a couple of  years at least, we're going to \\nstay as a contract brewed operation.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Understood, sir. Sir, last question on the financial front. All segments as reported within the deck \\nhave performed in line with expectations, except the Manufacturing segment because of the \\nheadwind faced on the raw material side. If you could just highli ght roughly what the spreads \\nwere on the gross level during the quarter? And what has it improved to?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Frankly, there were no spreads. That's why you saw the kind of performance that you see. In the \\nmiddle of the year, there was a complete sea change in raw material policy, which was \\ncompletely unexpected. Perhaps it was to do with the elections or some other reason, I'm not \\nsure, but it was an unprecedented decision.  \\nAs a result, it also happened at a time when the rice crop was coming in. So it led to a Q4 of \\nvery low raw material supplies available in the marketplace, which resulted in obviously price \\nincreases for commodities. What has happened coming into April and  May is that the maize crop \\ndue to the efforts of the company as well as others in the industry there was a huge amount of \\nfocus given to increasing maize cultivation in parts of North and East India. And a lot of that \\ncrop is now coming -- is now availabl e.  \\nThe harvest is happening now in May and in June. As a result, the industry has shifted its focus \\nfrom rice to maize, which is a more sustainable crop, I believe, for the future of ethanol in India. \\nSo as this change is playing out in May and June, we are s eeing recovery of margins, and we \\nhope, like I said in my opening remarks that this will continue. In fact, I believe that -- by the \\nend of this year, we will be back to our average level of margins that we have seen in the last \\nfew years, which is around INR7 per liter.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Understood, sir. So right now, we are at 100% maize for ENA and ethanol.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Not for ENA. For ethanol, we are using maize. For ENA, we continue to use rice.  \\nNitin Awasthi:  Okay. But I think then there will be a renegotiation which would have happened with the \\nconsumers for absorbing the price rise on rice?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. So ENA business is great in that sense, right, because you were able to pass on your costs. \\nSo ENA business has remained in that manner. On the other hand, ethanol is a fixed price \\nbusiness. So we need to secure raw material suppliers. And that's why FCI made so much sense                                          Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 9 of 22 \\n \\nbecause it was a single -- it was a fixed price input and a fixed price output, but of course, that \\npolicy changed completely. And now we are pivoting to maize and over some time, we will be \\nable to even secure long -term pricing of maize because there are no intermediaries involved.  \\nModerator:  The next question is from the line of Imran from Longbow India Capital.  \\nImran:  My first question is on the manufacturing business. I think this time, you have not provided the \\nnumber of liters that you produced, right? Can you please mention that?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Sure, Nilanjan, do you have that ready.  \\nImran:  Let me go to the other question while Nilanjan is looking for it. The second question is on the \\nconsumer business. I think the realizations have dropped in this quarter. Is it fair to assume that \\nthe Value Plus segment has not performed as per the expectat ion and this is the reason of this \\ndrop in the realization?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So realization for Regular & others has been good. I think you might mean the realization drop \\nin Prestige & Above.  \\nImran:  Well, there is an overall average realization, if I just simply divide the consumer business by the \\nlakh cases, right?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So are you combining both the categories of Prestige & Regular?  \\nImran:  Everything combined.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. So fine. Okay. So the right way to look at this is to separate the 2 businesses, Regular & \\nOthers and Prestige & Above. Prestige & Above, and the reason we are separating these 2 is \\nbecause there's different stages of business that these 2 categories are at, Regular & Others is a \\nmore entrenched business with very high market shares, lower growth and good profitability, in \\nfact, increasing every year at a pretty good hit.  \\nOn the other hand, Prestige & Above is a new business, but I mentioned, it's 2 or 3 years at the \\nmost for our oldest markets and loss -making because we are investing money, but on the other \\nhand, a very high -growth business. Now Prestige & Above realizatio n per case has been \\nchanging from quarter to quarter.  \\nImran:  Realizations, it's not the profitability. Anyway, I think I understand what you're saying. Let me \\nmove to the other things because I think we are short of time here. I will just quickly ask you a \\ncouple of more questions on the -- first on the manufacturin g side. At this time, you have also \\nnot provided power and fuel cost, if you can do that, Nilanjan. And then the other question is, \\nwhich is the bigger question, this time, I think from the last quarter, there has been a INR70 \\ncrore s, INR80 crore s drop in the manufacturing business. So can you share the capacity \\nutilization and the reason for this drop?                                           Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 10 of 22 \\n \\nShekhar Swarup:  We can share the capacity utilization and the production figures, no problem. The reason for \\ndrop is largely due to rice prices, as I mentioned earlier, we are now changing all of our ethanol \\nproduction to maize and we will see a change in margins coming i n on the bulk side as well.  \\nImran:  Right. And I think even in the last quarter, in last to last quarter, the broken rice prices were \\nsomewhere INR26 plus per kg, right? And if I just recollect, what my contacts have told me 10, \\n15 days back, that the rice prices are actually down about 10% in North India and about 15% in \\nthe East, specifically in West Bengal. Is it this information correct? And if s o how do you...  \\nShekhar Swarup:  I think the problem is the time periods you're looking at. You're absolutely right. The prices are \\ndown 10% to 15% today. In Q4, prices were up even more, we were looking at about INR29 to \\nINR30 per kg of rice in most parts of the country.  \\nImran:  But as we speak, I think it has cooled down to in West Bengal at least INR22, INR23 and in \\nRajasthan...  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. And I mentioned that in my opening remarks as well, that there has been softening of raw \\nmaterial prices in Q1.  \\nImran:  Right. And Shekhar, with this softening, I think it's a decent softening if we look at the impact, \\nI think INR4, INR5 on a minimum basis, right, on a per liter basis. So that will largely, I think \\nit will help you to gain more profitability in the consumer business, right? Because you will have \\nINR4, INR5 incremental price increase from April. And then on top of it, you will have this \\nanother INR4, INR5 per liter benefit of this raw material softening, right? So net -net, about \\nINR8, 10 on a liter bas is and maybe INR40 on a c hase basis.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Multiplied by about 3.5, not 4. But yes, you're right that there is a double impact of raw material \\nprice softening. It also improves profitability of our consumer business as well as improving \\nprofitability of our manufacturing business.  \\nImran:  And sorry, I forgot to thank you for giving this detailed, I think, breakup of consumer margins \\nand manufacturing margin. So very, very thankful for you to do this. I'll wait for Nilanjan to \\nmention… \\nNilanjan Sarkar:  I'll tell you, the production in Q4 has been 64.8 million liters. Our power and fuel cost for the \\nentire year has been INR245 crores.  \\nModerator:  The next question is from the line of Tushar Raghatate from Kamayakya Wealth Management \\nPrivate Limited.  \\nTushar Raghatate:  Just wanted to know, like  FY'24, what was our base as a percentage of the raw material market. \\nIn FY'25, how will you see that going forward?                                           Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 11 of 22 \\n \\nShekhar Swarup:  Negligible. Last year, maize's usage was negligible. We started trials and change in processes in \\nQ4, but it was negligible, the amount of maize that was used. In this financial year, for ethanol, \\nwe expect over 2/3 of our ethanol production to come from m aize?  \\nTushar Raghatate:  Fair enough. So what sort of margin -- EBITDA margin gains are you looking for?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  We are targeting an average EBITDA margin of INR7 a liter. There will be periods of even \\nhigher margins, and there will be periods of even lower margins than INR7. However, an average \\nof INR7 is what our target is.  \\nTushar Raghatate:  Fair enough, sir. So the consumer business probably 19% EBITDA margin. Just wanted to know \\nwhat was the  FY'23 number for that? And how do you see that for  FY'25, I mean the country \\nliquor business.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. So Regular & Others, EBITDA has grown by 22% year -on-year.  \\nTushar Raghatate:  Sir, how do you see that for  FY'25? \\nShekhar Swarup:  We expect further growth because we have got price increases in Rajasthan as well as the -- as \\nwas being discussed earlier on this call with softening raw material prices, that impacts \\nprofitability in our consumer business as well.  \\nTushar Raghatate:  Okay. So are you seeing 200 basis point near to growth on that.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  It's difficult to say right now, but we've demonstrated 18% to 20% kind of growth in profitability \\nlast 2, 3 years in Our Regular & Others brands. I hope to continue this momentum.  \\nTushar Raghatate:  And sir, your new business, Not Out and the beer business, what sort of target revenue are you \\nseeing for the next 2 years?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  We are not breaking up revenue targets within our Prestige business into different brands. We \\nhave a target -- we have very aggressive targets. We have delivered, 85% year -on-year growth \\nand in Q4, over 150% growth. We hope to have very aggressive growth c ontinuing this year. \\nAnd then let's see how where we end up at the end of this year -- this is a small base, right? So \\nyou're going to get 3 -digit type of growth right now. Once the base becomes larger, this number \\nwill reduce.  \\nTushar Raghatate:  Fair enough. So then my last question, the recent capex which we did, what sort of incremental \\nrevenue will be seen in  FY'25? \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes, I don't have that number. But Nilanjan, do you have that number of bas is Bengal be \\nJharkhand, what will be the...  \\nNilanjan Sarkar:  Yes, Bengal and Jharkhand, 60 KLPD will give you an additional revenue of anything between \\nINR215 crores to INR230 crores.                                           Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 12 of 22 \\n \\nTushar Raghatate:  Fair enough. And sir, the bottling will be over and above this, sir?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Bottling what, bottling in UP, you mean?  \\nTushar Raghatate:  Yes, yes, UP.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So that has already been accounted for when we spoke about volume growth of Prestige & \\nAbove as well as volume growth of Regular & Others. We are not going to be bottling brands \\nof other people. We are only going to bottle our own brands, yes.  \\nModerator:  The next question is from the line of Darshil Jhaveri from Crown Capital.  \\nDarshil Jhaveri:  Sir, some of my questions have already been answered. So just wanted to ask regarding our \\nPrestige & Other business . So our volumes are growing higher than our sales. So could you just \\nelaborate or give some more color on how is the price mix and product mix going out there?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So that is a stabilizing of our product mix that's taking place. It's a new business. Some brands \\nare growing faster than others. As you can see, there's been 170% volume growth in this period. \\nSo certain brands have outperformed other brands in this quart er. In the previous period, a higher \\nvalue brands were outperforming. So this a little bit of change in sales mix is going to happen. \\nIt will only be another year, year and a half before our average NSV, net sales value per case \\nsort of set tles down to a more reasonable number. For a year or 2, this number is going to be \\nfluctuating.  \\nNilanjan Sarkar:  Further to add  to Shekhar, the state mix also makes a difference to the revenue per case -- so \\nboth the combination of brands outperforming each other and the states outperforming each \\nother makes this thing.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Suffice it to say that the number to track for Prestige & Above is EBITDA growth as well as \\nvolume growth.  \\nDarshil Jhaveri:  Sir, we said EBITDA growth. So we said we are going to invest INR25 crores per year in \\nPrestige. So could we just see the losses reduced to that an EBITDA level? Or how would it \\nfunction in this current year, sir?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So I think what's going to happen in this year is that a large part of this loss is sales and \\ndistribution expenses as well as advertising and promotion. A lot of the sales and distribution \\ninfrastructure was created in advance before the volumes went up. So in some of the states where \\nvolumes are now becoming quite interesting, we are seeing sales and distribution costs dropped \\ndramatically because sales and distribution is not entirely a variable cost, most of it is fixed. \\nSimilarly, adver tising promotion is not a variable cost. Most of it is fixed. So as volumes go up, \\nyour profitability in state improves. So this year, we're going to start seeing a lot of this playing \\nout. Be that as it may, we'd also like to keep investing in growing new states and new states will \\ncontinue to bear losses. So over the next 12 to 24 months, we expect to be at a breakeven position \\nnet of all of this playing out.                                           Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 13 of 22 \\n \\nDarshil Jhaveri:  Sorry, that breakeven would be at EBITDA level or PAT level, sir?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  At EBITDA level, so interest cost will be more than this.  \\nDarshil Jhaveri:  Okay. So sir, if it's that 24 months at PBIT level, so we can assume maybe operating breakeven \\nthis year at Q4 level, may be at least the run rate, would that be a fair assumption, sir?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Operating level meaning gross level or what are you...  \\nDarshil Jhaveri:  We report EBITDA, sir, so currently, we think we have...  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. So EBITDA level 12 to 24 months, that's what I said.  \\nModerator:  The next question is from the line of Sunny Gosar from MK  Ventures.  \\nSunny Gosar:  And thank you for the improved disclosure. So I had a  couple of questions. The first one is the \\n-- bulk alcohol production that you mentioned of 64.8 million cases, that would be including \\nwhat is used for country liquor, basically your Value and Value Plus product segment, right?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  64 million liters, not cases.  \\nNilanjan Sarkar:  Yes, liters.  \\nSunny Gosar:  64 million liters is including what is internally consumed for IMFL and country liquor.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. \\nNilanjan Sarkar:  Yes. \\nSunny Gosar:  What would be the bulk alcohol sales, say, in the form of ethanol or ENA?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Sales has been for Q4, 48 million liters -- 48.7 million liters.  \\nSunny Gosar:  Okay, okay. Got it. Got it. And my second question is on the profitability of the Bulk Alcohol \\nsegment, so you have reported manufacturing EBITDA of about INR3.6 crores. And if I divide \\nthat by, say, 48.7 million liters, that comes to less than INR1 per liter of EBITDA. So is there \\nany one -off cost in this quarter, which is taking the EBITDA per liter so low? Or how should we \\nread into this?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  If you're asking if there's an exceptional item or anything like that, there is no such thing. It is a \\nresult of raw material prices, the way they have moved in Q4 results -- the reason they have \\nmoved the way they have is because there was supply of rice c oming from FCI, which got \\nstopped abruptly. So all of the demand, which was with FCI then came into the open market in \\naddition to the regular open market demand of rice and that is what drove our prices of rice.                                           Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 14 of 22 \\n \\n Going forward, we are now substituting rice with maize. The reason we could not substitute rice \\nwith maize earlier is because the crop of maize is a summer crop for North and East India. So \\ncrop has come now for the first time after the FCI banned supply o f rice for ethanol products.  \\nSunny Gosar:  So just 1 more question related to this. So in the last quarter, which is Q3  FY'24, you sold about \\n61 million liters of bulk alcohol, which has dropped to 48.7%. And is this because of demand \\nside challenges? Or is this because of our inability to supply because of lack of availability of \\nrice in the market?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So there's been some fluctuation during this period, which is largely to do with the changeover \\nfrom rice to maize. So that could also be playing a role in reduction of bulk sale. Nilanjan, do \\nyou have an analysis ready for that?  \\nNilanjan Sarkar:  No, what you said is correct. And to some extent, some lower capacity utilization in 2 of our \\nplants. So that has come back to normal now, but lower capacity in 2 of our plants.  \\nSunny Gosar:  Got it. Going forward, basically adjusted for the internal consumption for your IMFL and IMIL \\nsegment, how much volume of bulk alcohol can we sell on a quarterly basis with all the full \\ncapacity with Jharkhand and all the capacity having come...  \\nShekhar Swarup:  We can sell all of our surplus.  \\nSunny Gosar:  But That would be about 55 million liters or 60 million liters...  \\nShekhar Swarup:  I haven't computed the surplus. But on the demand side, there is no concern, really, especially \\nbecause of ethanol. Even if there is fluctuation, seasonal fluctuation that happens from time to \\ntime in our consumer business, where bulk alcohol sale increase s a little bit. There is no problem \\non the demand side for ethanol.  \\nSunny Gosar:  Got it. And 1 last question. On the IMIL side, basically, while we have seen so much pressure \\nof the raw material on the Bulk Alcohol segment, we have been able to increase our EBITDA \\nper case on a Y -o-Y basis from INR75 to INR85 in Q4  FY'24 in spite of a drop in realization. I \\nbelieve the raw material pressure would be equally there on the IMIL segment or, right? So in \\nthat segment, how have we been able to improve our EBITDA margin in such a...  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So there has been better purchasing that was done, improved costing in terms of specifications \\nof materials, in terms of better purchasing decisions, which has helped ease of or rather improve \\nmargins in Regular & Others. And since the company has such a s cale, we are able to really do \\nsome intelligent purchasing of packing material now.  \\nSunny Gosar:  But sir, on a Y -o-Y basis, we have seen moderation in realization per case, but -- and we would \\nhave seen a significant jump in your raw material cost per case, right, because of the increase in \\nrice prices.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  No. So I don't follow what you're saying. There has been an increase...                                           Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 15 of 22 \\n \\nSunny Gosar:  EBITDA per liter on the Bulk Alcohol segment has gone from INR12.5 in Q4  FY'23 to INR0.74 \\nper liter.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. \\nSunny Gosar:  Based on whatever reported -- segmental reported numbers that you've given...  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes, yes.  \\nSunny Gosar:  But on the contrary, our IMIL EBITDA per case has increased from INR75 per case to INR85 \\nper case. And I believe the raw material cost pressure, mainly the rice related pressure will be \\nsimilar on both the segments.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Sir, there are 3 components to the consumer business: one is selling price; second is packing \\nmaterial costs; and third is raw material cost. Raw material costs went up. Packing material \\nprices came down because of better purchasing and selling price went up. \\nSunny Gosar:  Maybe I can take it offline because your realization per case has dropped. So I was wondering \\nthat if the selling prices have gone up, how would your realization per case -- maybe we can \\ndiscuss this offline.  \\nNilanjan Sarkar:  The realization per case has not dropped.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  It has gone up. That's what I'm saying. I don't know what number you're looking at.  \\nSunny Gosar:  I just divided the country Value Plus revenue divided by the Value Plus number of cases that's \\ncoming to INR513 for this quarter versus INR528 for the previous quarter.  \\nNilanjan Sarkar:  We'll have to get back to the calculation. But the realization per case has not dropped.  \\nSunny Gosar:  Sure.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Let's take this offline. Yes, I'm not so sure what you're looking at there.  \\nModerator:  The next question is from the line of Nirav Seksaria from Living Root Analytics.  \\nNirav Seksaria:  So sir, What kind of brands are we looking forward to add in Prestige & Above because going \\nforward, that's going to drive us a better revenue and gross margin in the future?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So on our deck, we have a slide where we have shown the different categories of brands that are \\nbeing launched, please do refer to that. It has a lot of detail in terms of price point and flavor \\nsegment.  \\nNirav Seksaria:  I'm referring to that. But to follow up on that question, so we are adding 3 new brands when it \\ncomes to Prestige & Above whereas we added 4 to 5 new brands in Regular & Others, which is                                          Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 16 of 22 \\n \\nrelatively a lower margin business for us with relatively less pricing power.  Sir, any specific \\nreason why  \\nShekhar Swarup:  There are 2 brands in Regular & Others and 5 brands in Prestige & Above.  \\nNirav Seksaria:  Sir, are we adding new SKUs in each particular segments?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  No, these are new brands.  \\nParamjit Gill:  So SKUs adding is not counted here. These are new brands, not SKUs.  \\nNirav Seksaria:  Okay, sure. And what kind of initiatives are we taking to increase our brand awareness in such \\nmarkets?  \\nParamjit Gill:  So we have already started. I mean, we can't get into too many details. But in addition to \\nwhatever efforts we make at the marketplace knowing the limitations, obviously, within the \\nlimitations of that, digital marketing is also happening on in relevant ca tegories and relevant \\ngeographies. But as I said, there are limitations to what one can do. And within the framework, \\nwe are, as of now, slowly expanding into the 360 for the brand should get supported by in \\naddition to its presence at the s helf. \\nNirav Seksaria:  And going forward, any -- could you name out the next states that you are, guys, planning to \\nenter into?  \\nParamjit Gill:  We, as a principle, do not share in advance. As soon as the state happens, we do share. So I have \\ncalled out that we are planning to expand in 2 more states in this financial year, and we would \\nvery keenly share with the details with you as soon as it happ ens, knowing that we are operating \\nin a certain environment.  \\nModerator:  The next question is from the line of Dhruv Kashyap , who is an individual investor.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So this is a slightly more philosophical than a sort of 32,000 -feet above sea level question and \\nShekhar, addressed to you. So see, if you look at the landscape around you. And if you leave \\naside the sort of large multinational players, so in the more sort  of the challenger player, you \\nwould see that the guys who have really built consumer brands are the guys who are \\ncommanding sort of value, right? So if you look at Radico Khaitan or you now look at what \\nPiccadily has done with Indri, right?   \\nSo I always wanted to understand this to you that for a INR2,000 crore s, INR3,000 crore s \\nbusiness, we have amazing amount of complexity, right? And generally, the smaller the \\nbusiness, the lesser the complexity, the more focused on the target of sort of getting entrenched \\ninto the consumer space and really sort of commanding that value. So I' m just trying to \\nunderstand from you that we do this ENA, we do sort of ethanol, we do IMIL, we do IMFL and \\nwhen times go bad, like we are going through a vicious cycle and not a virtuous cycle in the last \\n2, 3 years, all the 4 sort of pillars come collaps ing down.                                           Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 17 of 22 \\n \\nSo I mean, what's your thought in terms of are we really looking at becoming a 100% consumer \\nfranchise someday? Or we always remain part of contract manufacturing; part sort of \\nmanufacturing; part consumer; part IMFL; part IMIL because I don't see how valu e will come \\nto such complexities. Mostly value has been created by very single -minded focus on building \\nbrands in this alcobev space in India.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So firstly, thanks for the question. I do not agree that all 4 pillars, like you said, have come \\ncrashing down. I think the Regular & Others business has been growing very well in terms of \\nprofitability and volumes. Even though it is a high -volume business  now with low growth, I'm \\npretty happy the way it is shaping up. The Prestige & Above business is a new business, the -- \\nall the state, we entered just over 2 years ago coming in on 3 years. That 2 brands over there \\nhave done exceedingly we ll currently, and we are hoping to increase our portfolio in this year.  \\n You're right about the margin erosion that has taken place in the Bulk business, but that is \\nsomething that is, how do I say, part of the gain. I have always maintained that margins in that \\nbusiness will go up and down. But our average of around INR7 a liter EBITDA margin is \\nsomething that we have been maintaining and we will continue to maintain. You have periods \\nwhere the number is closer to INR15, and you'll have periods where the number is closer to \\nINR2 or INR1.  \\nBut you will have an average of INR7, the combination of our Bulk business as well as our \\nRegular & Others business gives us the cash to be able to invest in the Prestige & Above \\nbusiness. the objective of Globus Spirits, of the management here is to be able to build an even \\nbigger consumer  franchise without diluting any equity without raising any funds for that journey. \\nI hope I've been able to put my philosophy clearly.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So I'm just trying to summarize what you said. You're saying that, one kind of gives you the \\nfunds to sort of really build the other? I'm just trying to simplify what you said. Yes So \\nphilosophically, then we are not very different where you are saying tha t ultimately, the objective \\nis to fuel growth in the consumer business by funding it.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. \\nDhruv Kashyap : Right. So the manufacturing business is not a means to an end. So ultimately, you would also be \\nhappy if you're sitting on a couple of INR1,000 crores, INR2,000 crores brands.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. \\nDhruv Kashyap : Yes. So that way you're just talking about this -- so you're just talking about the means to the \\nend being slightly different, but the endpoint is pretty much same in what both of us are talking. \\nAnd hence, the time lines and all might be different. But bo ttom line is you are not in a very \\ndifferent space from what I just said.                                           Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 18 of 22 \\n \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. Yes. I mean our focus is building a consumer business. The cash for building that consumer \\nbusiness comes from Regular & Others and comes from the Bulk business.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : And you don't think there's too much of complexity in the end points. You're trying to build \\nIMIL, regular, Value Plus, IMFL then the Craft segment, the craft whiskey, craft gin. Is that not \\ntoo complex to build us, I mean...  \\nShekhar Swarup:  No, we don't think it's too complicated.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : That's not the way most other guys are going, right? The other guys are trying to get wins in 1 \\nor 2 big categories?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So okay, let's just talk about the other guys for a minute, okay? The other guys have achieved \\ncertain wins. So they talk about those wins. They do not talk about the journey. In case of Globus \\nSpirits, we are on that journey, and we are talking to you abo ut how we are on that journey. Our \\nwins have been in setting up a solid Regular & Other franchise. Our wins has been in setting up \\nreally good assets cheaply and being able to operate really well. Those are our wins -- those are \\nour wins cu rrently.  \\nWhen it comes to Prestige & Above, we are very much on the journey right now. And for me to \\ntalk about just SNOSKI, for example, is insufficient because SNOSKI is one part of our journey \\nright now. Maybe 2 or 3 years down, when we've got 8 to 10 brands, we  are not launching any \\nmore brands, out of these 8 to 10 brands, you've got 3 brands that are more successful than the \\nothers, then we just talk about those successes.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So you're saying that ultimately, a good presence in sort of that craft or -- sort of Indian made \\nsort of nice whiskeys and gins and all then there would be something in the sort of regular IMFL \\nspace, there will be something in the IMIL. But ultimately, y ou also see that a few years down \\nthe line, there will be 1, 2, 3 big wins, which will be our big business drivers. I'm talking about \\nconsumer brands, sorry, just to be clear.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Absolutely.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So that's what I just want to understand that are we sort of aligned because I've been invested for \\na long time, but I wasn't sure whether you're aligned on the philosophy. So that's great. So that's \\none piece of clarity. The second one was on the manufact uring...  \\nModerator:  Sorry to interrupt you, sir. May I request you to please follow the queue?  \\nDhruv Kashyap : I just asked one question . Yes. So the second question was that on the manufacturing side. And \\nI'm just trying to understand this. So if it's been covered or if it's irritating, you can stop me, but \\nmost of my understanding, you have a significant presence in the East, right? And yo u've been \\nexpanding capacities there as well. And then you have a presence in the north. Now what I \\nunderstand from you is that very soon, we'll be moving all of ethanol to corn or maize, right?                                          Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 19 of 22 \\n \\nNow is that predominantly East? Or would you -- or do we not manufacture any ethanol at all in \\nthe north?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  North manufacturing of ethanol is very small. It's only about 70,000 or 80,000 liters per day in \\nHaryana. So yes, I mean, if we were manufacturing more ethanol in the north, we would have \\nlooked at maize in the north as well. But we are able to get enough rice at a decent cost for that \\nsmall capacity. So I'm not shifting to maize in the north.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So it would be fair to say that your ethanol is -- maybe 70%, 80% plus is coming from the East.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. \\nDhruv Kashyap : Maybe even more, right?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Maybe even more.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So in which case, you are saying that whole thing will move over to maize, and there should be \\na more sort of sustained supply as well given the government initiatives, and I'm told IIT is \\ntrying to get some new seeds, et cetera, which gives you a better yield. So with all that focus, \\nand all the politicians have been going around saying that they are growing oil crops and not \\nfood crops anymore. I'm told there's a lot of effort. Now with all of that,  wouldn't the cost of \\nENA come down significantly from where we are today?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Cost of ENA or ethanol?  \\nDhruv Kashyap : Sorry, cost of manufacturing ethanol, sorry, my mistake.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes, that is what we are seeing. You're absolutely right. There is a lot of focus on maize. Maize \\nbecause there are no intermediaries, there's no rice mills, we are able to contract long term for \\nmaize supplies. It's not -- we're not fully there yet on mai ze. This is the first Season of maize -- \\nor the first -- rather sustained period of maize ethanol supplies in India, it will take maybe 1 or \\n2 maize crop seasons for us to complete that whole journey. But yes, the journey is very exciting.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So just to understand this with an example, I mean just given -- you might not want to share \\nexact figures, but ballpark, what was the maize procurement price before and what is it now? \\nBallpark. I mean, don't need to be exact.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So the procurement price is not as relevant as the margin per liter because the price has gone up \\nyear-on-year but so has the ethanol price year -on-year.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : Yes. So that's also gone up from 56% to almost 72% now. So I just want to understand the \\nmargin, sorry, not the … \\nShekhar Swarup:  So in the past, it was not whatever it was 58% or whatever the old number was. It was not viable \\nto make ethanol from maize at all. But at the INR71.8 or INR72 level that we are at today, a                                          Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 20 of 22 \\n \\nINR7 per liter average margin is very much possible. We've seen periods already in Q1, and I'm \\ntalking about very short periods, obviously, where the margins are even greater than INR10 a \\nliter. Okay. So that's why I keep coming back to this, that the average margins with maize, I \\nbelieve, now are very much possible to be at around INR7 a liter.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : And just a quick follow -up on that, that maize procurement would be what now, about INR21, \\nINR22 a kg? Or is it more, is it less?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  It's between INR22 and INR24. \\nDhruv Kashyap : Okay. So that means it hasn't come down at all because wasn't it about INR24 last quarter as \\nwell?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  No, it was INR26, INR25. \\nDhruv Kashyap : So it has come down. Okay. And hence, my last -- so you're saying it's between INR22 to INR24 \\nnow. And irrespective of that, given the INR72 a liter given the throughput, et cetera, and Globus \\nalways has a better throughput than the rest of the industry in terms of conversion. My guess is \\nthat, that INR7 a liter should be doable, maybe even more or less at times. That's what you're \\nsaying.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  INR7 Is an average that we are shooting for, yes.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : And you said that there are sometimes in Q1, you got INR10 also, sometimes you'll get below, \\nbut INR7-plus shouldn't be a big challenge in the medium term is what you're saying, yes?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. \\nDhruv Kashyap : And my last question was, sir, on the rice part. What is the rice procurement price now versus \\nearlier?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Rice has become much cheaper now as compared to Q4. So at the current level of rice and maize, \\nit's equal profitability. But we are supporting maize cultivation, et cetera, because maize is a \\nmuch better crop for ethanol going forward.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So if I've understood you correctly, at INR64 a liter at which the OMCs buy from you, and at \\nwhatever price you're buying rice versus INR72 a liter they procure from you and at INR22 to \\nINR24 that you're buying maize, the profitability is almost the same?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. Rice much cheaper to convert.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : Yes. Because I think the throughput is there are about 440 to 460 liters versus, I think maize is \\nabout 385, 390 or thereabout, right? So there's almost a 15% or 20% extra throughput that you \\nget from your rice conversion.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes.                                          Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 21 of 22 \\n \\nDhruv Kashyap : So would you be able to help me with the rice price earlier versus now that you're procuring it?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So in the East, we're not really buying too much rice. It's around INR24, INR25 right  in the East.  \\nNilanjan Sarkar:  Yes, yes. Yes.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : And is it any different in the North or is it the same?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  INR23, INR24, north is a little bit cheaper right now.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So ballpark INR23 to INR25, if I talk about the whole country average versus it was about \\nINR27, INR28, INR29 earlier, right?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  INR29, INR28 in Q4.  \\nDhruv Kashyap : So that's almost a 15%, 20% cooling off of the prices.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Yes. \\nModerator:  The next question is from the line of Munjal Shah , who is an individual investor.  \\nMunjal Shah : Shekhar, it might be a repetitive question. I just wanted to understand when you mentioned that \\nyou were excited about maize being the raw material for ethanol than rice. Can you just throw \\nsome light on why -- like what was the difference? So I understand  the conversion of rice is \\nmuch faster than maize. But why maize would be better going forward. If you can just help me \\nunderstand?  \\nShekhar Swarup:  So there are 2 reasons. One is that in terms of maize cultivation and rice cultivation, maize uses \\nfar less water as compared to rice and from an environmental standpoint, it's obviously much \\nbetter for the country. Second is that we use broken rice, which  is about 7% of the total rice \\nproduction. Rice production itself is only about 67% of the total paddy harvest, so in effect, we \\nuse maybe, what, 5% of the total crop by weight. So if you look at the yield of ethanol per acre, \\nin terms of m aize and rice, maize is far superior.  \\nAs a result, the number of farmers, the amount of land area required for cultivation is -- for \\nethanol -- for our ethanol capacity is much lower. But the most interesting thing, frankly, is that \\nmaize is a crop that is not purchased by the Government of In dia. It is not purchased by -- it is \\nnot produced by intermediaries such as rice mills. And as a result, it can be a direct farmer to \\nfactory kind of model. And for that reason, we are very excited about it.  \\nModerator:  Ladies and gentlemen, we will take that as a last question. I'd now like to hand the conference \\nover to Mr. Shekhar Swarup for closing comments.  \\nShekhar Swarup:  Thank you very much for your time and your questions. In case there are questions we are not \\nable to answer, please reach out to us, to Nilanjan or to the Investor Relations team, and we'll do \\nour best to get back to you. Thank you very much.                                           Globus Spirits Limited  \\n  May 30, 202 4 \\n \\nPage 22 of 22 \\n \\nModerator:  On behalf of Globus Spirits Limited, that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us, \\nand you may now disconnect your lines.  \""
